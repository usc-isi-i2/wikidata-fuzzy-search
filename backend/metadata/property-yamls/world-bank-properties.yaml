    - 'Net bilateral aid flows from DAC donors are the net disbursements of official
      development assistance (ODA) or official aid from the members of the Development
      Assistance Committee (DAC). Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants
      and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans
      made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated
      at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development
      and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients.
      Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories
      in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central
      and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced
      developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and
      conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in
      2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part
      II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium,

    - Bilateral debt includes loans from governments and their agencies (including
      central banks), loans from autonomous bodies, and direct loans from official
      export credit agencies. Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original
      grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a loan is the grant
      equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as
      a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is
      its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual
      debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.
      Principal repayments are actual amounts of principal (amortization) paid by
      the borrower in currency, goods, or services in the year specified. Data are
      in current U.S. dollars.

    - Principal repayments are actual amounts of principal (amortization) paid by
      the borrower in currency, goods, or services in the year specified. This item
      includes principal repayments on long-term debt and IMF repurchases. Long-term
      external debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of
      more than one year and that is owed to nonresidents by residents of an economy
      and repayable in currency, goods, or services. IMF repurchases are total repayments
      of outstanding drawings from the General Resources Account during the year specified,
      excluding repayments due in the reserve tranche. To maintain comparability between
      data on transactions with the IMF and data on long-term debt, use of IMF credit
      outstanding at the end of year (stock) is converted to dollars at the SDR exchange
      rate in effect at the end of year. Repurchases (flows) are converted at the
      average SDR exchange rate for the year in which transactions take place. Data
      are in current U.S. dollars.

    - Concessional external debt conveys information about the borrower's receipt
      of aid from official lenders at concessional terms as defined by the Development
      Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. Concessional debt is defined as loans
      with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a
      loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed.
      It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent
      of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value
      of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are
      discounted at 10 percent. Loans from major regional development banks--African
      Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development
      Bank--and from the World Bank are classified as concessional according to each
      institution's classification and not according to the DAC definition, as was
      the practice in earlier reports. Long-term debt outstanding and disbursed is
      the total outstanding long-term debt at year end. Long-term external debt is
      defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than one year
      and that is owed to nonresidents and repayable in currency, goods, or services.

    - Maturity is the number of years to original maturity date, which is the sum
      of grace and repayment periods. Grace period for principal is the period from
      the date of signature of the loan or the issue of the financial instrument to
      the first repayment of principal. The repayment period is the period from the
      first to last repayment of principal. To obtain the average, the maturity for
      all public and publicly guaranteed loans have been weighted by the amounts of

    - Maturity is the number of years to original maturity date, which is the sum
      of grace and repayment periods. Grace period for principal is the period from
      the date of signature of the loan or the issue of the financial instrument to
      the first repayment of principal. The repayment period is the period from the
      first to last repayment of principal. To obtain the average, the maturity for
      all public and publicly guaranteed loans have been weighted by the amounts of
      the loans. Debt from official creditors includes loans from international organizations
      (multilateral loans) and loans from governments (bilateral loans). Loans from
      international organization include loans and credits from the World Bank, regional
      development banks, and other multilateral and intergovernmental agencies. Excluded
      are loans from funds administered by an international organization on behalf
      of a single donor government; these are classified as loans from governments.
      Government loans include loans from governments and their agencies (including
      central banks), loans from autonomous bodies, and direct loans from official
      export credit agencies.

    - Bilateral debt includes loans from governments and their agencies (including

      export credit agencies. Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original
      grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a loan is the grant
      equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as
      a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is
      its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual
      debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.
      Net flows (or net lending or net disbursements) received by the borrower during

    - Net flows on external debt are disbursements on long-term external debt and
      IMF purchases minus principal repayments on long-term external debt and IMF
      repurchases up to 1984. Beginning in 1985 this line includes the change in stock
      of short-term debt (including interest arrears for long-term debt). Thus, if
      the change in stock is positive, a disbursement is assumed to have taken place;
      if negative, a repayment is assumed to have taken place. Long-term external
      debt is defined as debt that has an original or extended maturity of more than

      international organization on behalf of a single donor government; these are

      with an original grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a
      loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed.
      It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent
      of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value
      of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are
      discounted at 10 percent. Net flows (or net lending or net disbursements) received
      by the borrower during the year are disbursements minus principal repayments.

    - Bilateral debt includes loans from governments and their agencies (including
      central banks), loans from autonomous bodies, and direct loans from official
      export credit agencies. Concessional debt is defined as loans with an original
      grant element of 25 percent or more. The grant element of a loan is the grant
      equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed. It is used as
      a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent of a loan is
      its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value of its contractual
      debt service; conventionally, future service payments are discounted at 10 percent.
      Net transfers are net flows minus interest payments during the year; negative
      transfers show net transfers made by the borrower to the creditor during the
      year. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

    - Droughts, floods and extreme temperatures is the annual average percentage of
      the population that is affected by natural disasters classified as either droughts,
      floods, or extreme temperature events. A drought is an extended period of time
      characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result
      of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture,
      affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking
      water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream,
      lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold
      waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively
      cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along
      with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.
      A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid
      weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population
      affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate
      assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it
      can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population
      affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period
      stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.

    - 'CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production is the sum of three IEA
      categories of CO2 emissions: (1) Main Activity Producer Electricity and Heat
      which contains the sum of emissions from main activity producer electricity
      generation, combined heat and power generation and heat plants. Main activity
      producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings
      whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately
      owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions
      from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel
      in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers
      which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat
      by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity
      and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports
      their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996
      IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry,
      transport and "other" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions
      from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels,
      coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This
      corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According
      to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can
      either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category.
      Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished.
      In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke,
      the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions
      can be considered as an industrial process. Care must be taken not to double
      count these emissions in both Energy and Industrial Processes. In the IEA estimations,
      these emissions have been included in this category.'

    - CO2 emissions from transport contains emissions from the combustion of fuel
      for all transport activity, regardless of the sector, except for international
      marine bunkers and international aviation. This includes domestic aviation,
      domestic navigation, road, rail and pipeline transport, and corresponds to IPCC
      Source/Sink Category 1 A 3. In addition, the IEA data are not collected in a
      way that allows the autoproducer consumption to be split by specific end-use
      and therefore, autoproducers are shown as a separate item (Unallocated Autoproducers).

      Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all
      residents regardless of legal status or citizenship--except for refugees not
      permanently settled in the country of asylum, who are generally considered part
      of the population of their country of origin. Land area is a country's total
      area, excluding area under inland water bodies, national claims to continental
      shelf, and exclusive economic zones. In most cases the definition of inland
      water bodies includes major rivers and lakes.

      of equity and financial derivatives held by the government. Because debt is

    - Distance to frontier score illustrates the distance of an economy to the "frontier,"
      which represents the best performance observed on each Doing Business topic
      across all economies and years included since 2005. An economy's distance to
      frontier is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest
      performance and 100 the frontier. For example, a score of 75 in 2012 means an
      economy was 25 percentage points away from the frontier constructed from the
      best performances across all economies and across time. A score of 80 in 2013

      to import goods. Time is recorded in calendar days. The time calculation for
      a procedure starts from the moment it is initiated and runs until it is completed.
      If a procedure can be accelerated for an additional cost, the fastest legal
      procedure is chosen. It is assumed that neither the exporter nor the importer
      wastes time and that each commits to completing each remaining procedure without
      delay. Procedures that can be completed in parallel are measured as simultaneous.
      The waiting time between procedures--for example, during unloading of the cargo--is

    - Industrial design applications are applications to register an industrial design
      with a national or regional Intellectual Property (IP) offices and designations

      applied to a wide variety of industrial products and handicrafts. They refer
      to the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of a useful article, including compositions
      of lines or colors or any three-dimensional forms that give a special appearance
      to a product or handicraft. The holder of a registered industrial design has
      exclusive rights against unauthorized copying or imitation of the design by
      third parties. Industrial design registrations are valid for a limited period.
      The term of protection is usually 15 years for most jurisdictions. However,
      differences in legislation do exist, notably in China (which provides for a
      10-year term from the application date). Non-resident application refers to
      an application filed with the IP office of or acting on behalf of a state or
      jurisdiction in which the first-named applicant in the application is not domiciled.
      Design count is used to render application data for industrial applications

    - Annual growth rate for industrial value added based on constant local currency.
      Aggregates are based on constant 2010 U.S. dollars. Industry corresponds to
      ISIC divisions 10-45 and includes manufacturing (ISIC divisions 15-37). It comprises
      value added in mining, manufacturing (also reported as a separate subgroup),
      construction, electricity, water, and gas. Value added is the net output of
      a sector after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. It
      is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets
      or depletion and degradation of natural resources. The origin of value added
      is determined by the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC),
      revision 3.

    - Natural resource depletion is the sum of net forest depletion, energy depletion,
      and mineral depletion. Net forest depletion is unit resource rents times the
      excess of roundwood harvest over natural growth. Energy depletion is the ratio
      of the value of the stock of energy resources to the remaining reserve lifetime.
      It covers coal, crude oil, and natural gas. Mineral depletion is the ratio of
      the value of the stock of mineral resources to the remaining reserve lifetime).
      It covers tin, gold, lead, zinc, iron, copper, nickel, silver, bauxite, and

      exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank.
      This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given
      year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation
      between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan,

      factor to market exchange rate is the result obtained by dividing the PPP conversion
      factor by the market exchange rate. The ratio, also referred to as the national
      price level, makes it possible to compare the cost of the bundle of goods that
      make up gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. It tells how many dollars

    - Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some
      cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy
      deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative
      percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients,
      starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the
      area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality,
      expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index
      of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.

      initial year)^(1/(Final year - Initial year)) - 1.  The reference year is the
      year in which the underlying household survey data was collected. In cases for
      which the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the first year
      in which data were collected is reported. The initial year refers to the nearest

      in Africa, people recognized as refugees in accordance with the UNHCR statute,
      people granted refugee-like humanitarian status, and people provided temporary
      protection. Asylum seekers--people who have applied for asylum or refugee status
      and who have not yet received a decision or who are registered as asylum seekers--are
      excluded. Palestinian refugees are people (and their descendants) whose residence
      was Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948 and who lost their homes and means
      of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict. Country of asylum
      is the country where an asylum claim was filed and granted.

    - International migrant stock is the number of people born in a country other
      than that in which they live. It also includes refugees. The data used to estimate
      the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from
      population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born
      population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another
      country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on
      foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than
      the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of
      the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries
      who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates
      of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the
      1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international
      migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation
      was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference
      years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference
      years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding
      or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate
      migrants for countries that had no data.

    - International inbound tourists (overnight visitors) are the number of tourists
      who travel to a country other than that in which they have their usual residence,
      but outside their usual environment, for a period not exceeding 12 months and
      whose main purpose in visiting is other than an activity remunerated from within
      the country visited. When data on number of tourists are not available, the
      number of visitors, which includes tourists, same-day visitors, cruise passengers,
      and crew members, is shown instead. Sources and collection methods for arrivals
      differ across countries. In some cases data are from border statistics (police,
      immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases
      data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number
      of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying
      in hotels. Some countries include arrivals of nationals residing abroad while
      others do not. Caution should thus be used in comparing arrivals across countries.
      The data on inbound tourists refer to the number of arrivals, not to the number
      of people traveling. Thus a person who makes several trips to a country during
      a given period is counted each time as a new arrival.

      parties in the conflict dyad (two conflict units that are parties to a conflict).
      Typically, battle-related deaths occur in warfare involving the armed forces
      of the warring parties. This includes traditional battlefield fighting, guerrilla
      activities, and all kinds of bombardments of military units, cities, and villages,
      etc. The targets are usually the military itself and its installations or state
      institutions and state representatives, but there is often substantial collateral
      damage in the form of civilians being killed in crossfire, in indiscriminate
      bombings, etc. All deaths--military as well as civilian--incurred in such situations,

      in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly cohesive groups of up to several
