Peacekeepers deploy to war-torn regions where no one else is willing or able to go and prevent conflict from returning or escalating. Peacekeepers include police, troops, and military observers.", "aliases": []}, "P1200134": {"label": "Percent share of total households that use kerosene for fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200135": {"label": "Percent share of rural households that use kerosene for fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200136": {"label": "Percent share of urban households that use kerosene for fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200137": {"label": "Percent share of total households that use electricity for fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200138": {"label": "Percent share of urban households that use electricity for fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200139": {"label": "Percent share of rural households that use biogas for fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200140": {"label": "Percent share of  households that use gas, biogas and other types of fuels", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200141": {"label": "Percent share of rural households that use electricity, gas and other types of fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200142": {"label": "Percent share of urban households that use  gas, biogas and other types of fuel", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200143": {"label": "Percent share of households that use open space/behind the housing unit for waste disposal", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200144": {"label": "Percent share of households that use burning /burying for waste disposal", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200145": {"label": "Percent share of households that use municipality collector services (public dump) for waste disposal", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200146": {"label": "Percent share of households that use dumping in river for waste disposal", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200147": {"label": "Percent share of households that use private establishments/individuals services for waste disposal", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200148": {"label": "Percent share of households that use other methods for waste disposal", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200119": {"label": "Percent share of households having no toilet facility", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200120": {"label": "Percent share of households having private pit latrine toilet facility", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P1200121": {"label": "Percent share of households having shared pit latrine toilet facility", "description": "\u00ad", "aliases": []}, "P111402": {"label": "Tariff rate, most favored nation, weighted mean, all products (%)", "description": "Weighted mean most favored nations tariff is the average of most favored nation rates weighted by the product import shares corresponding to each partner country.
